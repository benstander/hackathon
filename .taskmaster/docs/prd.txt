**Project Title:** Kapital - Conversational AI Financial Assistant

**1. Introduction & Vision**
Kapital is a mobile financial application that reinvents budgeting by transforming it into a natural, conversational experience. Instead of tedious manual data entry and complex dashboards, Kapital acts as a financially savvy friend that communicates with the user via text. The vision is to create a conversational layer on top of personal finance, making financial awareness seamless and integrated into the user's daily life.

**2. Problem Statement**
Traditional budgeting methods are failing. People know they should manage their finances but are deterred by the high friction of existing tools. Manual data entry is tedious, spreadsheets are confusing, and conventional budgeting apps are often abandoned because they require constant, proactive management and become quickly outdated. This leads to a lack of real-time financial awareness and poor financial decision-making.

**3. Target Audience**
Millennials and Gen Z who are comfortable with digital communication (texting, messaging apps) and are looking for a low-effort, high-impact way to manage their personal finances. They value convenience, personalization, and proactive assistance.

**4. Core Features**

*   **Conversational Interface:**
    *   The primary user interface will be a chat/text-based conversation.
    *   The AI will proactively text users about their transactions.
    *   Users can ask questions and interact with their financial data in natural language.
    *   Example interactions: "How was lunch? Is that a business expense?", "You've spent $150 on coffee this month. Want to set a goal to reduce that?"

*   **Automatic Transaction Categorization:**
    *   The app will securely connect to the user's bank accounts and credit cards to pull transaction data in real-time.
    *   An AI model will automatically categorize expenses (e.g., food, transport, entertainment).
    *   The AI will learn from user corrections to improve categorization accuracy over time (e.g., if a user clarifies "lunch was a business expense").

*   **Personalized AI Personality:**
    *   The AI will analyze the user's communication style and adapt its personality to match.
    *   The tone can range from witty and encouraging to straightforward and informative, based on user preference and interaction history.

*   **Proactive Insights and Alerts:**
    *   The AI will identify spending patterns and trends.
    *   It will provide proactive suggestions and alerts to help users stay on track with their budget.
    *   Example: "You're getting close to your 'dining out' budget for the month. Maybe a home-cooked meal tonight?"

*   **Frictionless Onboarding:**
    *   Simple and secure process to link financial accounts (e.g., using Plaid).
    *   Minimal setup required from the user to get started.

**5. Technical Stack (Initial Proposal)**
*   **Mobile App:** React Native or Flutter for cross-platform support.
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express/NestJS.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data (user profiles, settings) and a vector database (e.g., Pinecone) for conversational context.
*   **AI/LLM:** OpenAI's GPT series (or similar) for conversational logic and personality.
*   **Financial Data Aggregation:** Plaid API to connect to bank accounts.
*   **Messaging/Push Notifications:** Twilio for SMS or a push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).

**6. Success Metrics (V1)**
*   High user engagement (daily/weekly active users).
*   High accuracy of automatic transaction categorization (>90%).
*   Positive user feedback on the AI's personality and helpfulness.
*   Successful onboarding and linking of financial accounts.
